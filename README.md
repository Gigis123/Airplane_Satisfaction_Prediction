# Airplane_Satisfaction_Prediction
This project aims to develop a predictive model to determine whether airline customers will leave positive or negative feedback based on their satisfaction levels. The model leverages data from recent customer satisfaction surveys to forecast customer sentiment, enabling the airline to enhance service quality and boost customer retention.
