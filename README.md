# Project Description
This project was created to create a prediction model to predict whether a customer from an airline will leave a positive or negative comment regarding the service provided during their flights. the program will try to give insight on what factors affect a customer satisfaction and make decision on what aspect should an airline improve in order to increase the overall customer satisfaction during their flight which will in turn increase the airline customer's retention. After the creation of the prediction model, the prediction model will be uploaded into hugging face in order to be used by other.
